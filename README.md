# ðŸŽ§ CodecFake+: A Large-Scale Neural Audio Codecâ€“Based Deepfake Speech Dataset

> A benchmark for studying **neural codecâ€“based deepfake speech detection** and **robustness analysis**.

---

## ðŸ§© Overview
**CodecFake+** is a large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate the detection and generalization capabilities of models across diverse neural audio codecâ€“generated deepfakes.  
It enables controlled, taxonomy-aware analysis for codec-based deepfake research.
